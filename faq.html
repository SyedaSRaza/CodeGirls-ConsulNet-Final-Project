		<h2 class="center-div1">You can find practical advice and the answers to your questions here!</h2>
        	<div id="accordion">
  <h2>Who are the Four-legged friends?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
   When you make your hotel booking, don’t forget to ask if they are prepared to accept your pet, and if so, subject to which conditions. The charge can vary
   from hotel to hotel but usually ranges from €5 to €15 per animal. Be as precise as possible, because a hotel may refuse dogs over a certain size for example.
   As far as guide-dogs are concerned, they are accepted, by law, in all hotels and may also give rise to a supplementary charge. An advanced search on our
   web site will narrow your choice down to those hotels who welcome pets
     
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Can I speak my language?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
    All information is offered in several languages, it is compulsory for hotels with 2** and above to be competent in at least one foreign language, most 
	commonly English. In most types of accommodation, English is used as a matter of course and you should have no difficulty with understandin
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Electric adapters and plugs</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
    In France, the norm is 220 volts, 50 cycles, while in the United States or Canada, for example, it is 110 volts, 60 cycles. Voltage and sockets vary from 
	country to country and so an adapter and also a transformer will be indispensable in order to keep your favorite electric razor or hair dryer in working
	order – not to mention to avoid blowing the electricity in the whole hotel
    </p>	
  </div>
  <h2>What do I out in my safe?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
	Hotels and apart hotels may place safe deposit boxes at your disposal either in your room or at the reception: very useful for keeping your jewelry and
	other valuables safe! You could also keep a copy of your identity documents here, helpful in case you should lose the originals. The hotel is responsible 
	for valuables entrusted to them by their guests. In the event of theft or damage, the hotel’s liability is automatically incurred – although the level of 
	compensation will vary.
    </p>
  </div>
   <h2>High or low season?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
	High season is between 1st April and 31st October. Cruises on the Seine river also operate more regularly and offer an extended timetable during this
	period. Low season is from the 1st of November till the 31st of March
    </p>
  </div>
   <h2>Smokers allowed?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
	The majority of non-smoking rooms are available in hotel chains. As yet few hotels in Paris provide non-smoking rooms for their guests, so clients can
	smoke in their rooms at their discretion, except if there is a sign specifically prohibiting it. Hotels must ensure ventilation standards are complied with.
	As for the communal areas, breakfast room, reception, and corridors: these are usually non-smoking. As a rule, youth hostels are entirely non-smoking
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>It is possible to hire pushchair or wheelchair?</h2>
   <div>
    <p>
	That depends on the museum, it is best to make inquiries at each museum beforehand.
